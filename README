port = TBD (at the moment: 0x01)

Quick experiments with Gimasi's Loraduino/Tuino cloud suggest
that the maximum payload length is 0x33 (51) bytes.

Payload is consisting of several commands in a Type-Length-Value
format.  The first byte is consisting of Type (bits [7:4]),
defining the command, and Length (bits [3:0]), the length of the
arguments in bytes.  If the Length bits are 0xF (binary 1111),
the command has its length specified in bits [5:0] of the second
byte.

The commands are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------

0	Get params	TBD	TBD

1	Set params	TBD	TBD

2	Reboot/Upgrade	0	Reboot the mote immediately.
			1	Reboot the mote after the
				specified timeout; optionally
				tuun BLE and SUOTA on for
				upgrades.  The argument is as
				follows:
				bit [7]:
					0	just reboot
					1	BLE on
				bits [6:3]:
						Reserved
				bits [2:0]:
					0	TBD
					1	5 minutes
					2	15 minutes
					3	30 minutes
					4	1 hour
					5	2 hours
					6	4 hours
					7	TBD

Response: TBD
