port = TBD (at the moment: 0x01)

Quick experiments with Gimasi's Loraduino/Tuino cloud suggest
that the maximum payload length is 0x33 (51) bytes.

Payload is consisting of several commands in a Type-Length-Value
(TLV) format.  The first byte is consisting of Type (bits [7:4]),
defining the command, and Length (bits [3:0]), the length of the
arguments in bytes.  If the Length bits are 0xF (binary 1111),
the command has its length specified in bits [5:0] of the second
byte.

The commands are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------

0	Get/set params	1	Get parameter described by fitst
				byte.
			>=2	Set parameter described by first
				byte to the value specified in
				the rest of the message.

				Parameters are as follows:

				param	len	description
				0	6	DevEUI-48 and BLE
						MAC address (MSBF)
				1	8	AppEUI-64 (MSBF)
				2	16	AppKey
						(write-only)
				3	TBD	Sensor period

				Parameters 0, 1 and 2 are
				actualized after reboot.

1	Reboot/Upgrade	0	Reboot the mote immediately.
			1	Reboot the mote after the
				specified timeout; optionally
				tuun BLE and SUOTA on for
				upgrades.  The argument is as
				follows:
				bit [7]:
					0	just reboot
					1	BLE on
				bits [6:3]:
						Reserved
				bits [2:0]:
					0	TBD
					1	5 minutes
					2	15 minutes
					3	30 minutes
					4	1 hour
					5	2 hours
					6	4 hours
					7	TBD

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------
0	Param value	>=2	Response to the "Get params"
				command.  The first byte is the
				param number, the rest are the
				value.
1	Sensor data	>=1	Sensor data, consisting of one or
				more TLV chunks, where Type is
				the sensor type, as defined in
				sensor.c.
2	Battery level	1	Battery level in 10mV steps from
				2V (0 = 2V, 255 = 4.55V).
