Quick experiments with Gimasi's Loraduino/Tuino cloud suggest
that the maximum payload length is 0x33 (51) bytes.

Payload is consisting of several commands in a Type-Length-Value
format.  The first byte is consisting of Type (high 4 bits),
defining the command, and Length (low 4 bits), the length of the
arguments in bytes.  If the Length bits are 0xF (binary 1111),
the command has its length specified in the second byte.

The commands are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------

0	Get params	TBD	TBD

1	Set params	TBD	TBD

2	Reboot/Upgrade	0	Reboot the mote immediately.
			1	Reboot the mote after the
				specified timeout; optionally
				tuun BLE and SUOTA on for
				upgrades.  The argument is as
				follows:
				High bit:
					0	just reboot
					1	BLE on
				Low 7 bits:
					00	TBD
					01	5 minutes
					02	15 minutes
					03	30 minutes
					04	1 hour
					05	2 hours
					06	4 hours
					07-0F	TBD

Response: TBD
