port = TBD (at the moment: 0x01)

Quick experiments with Gimasi's Loraduino/Tuino cloud suggest
that the maximum payload length is 0x33 (51) bytes.

Payload is consisting of several commands in a Type-Length-Value
(TLV) format.  The first byte is consisting of Type (bits [7:4]),
defining the command, and Length (bits [3:0]), the length of the
arguments in bytes.  If the Length bits are 0xF (binary 1111),
the command has its length specified in bits [5:0] of the second
byte.

Downlink commands are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------

0	Get/set params	1	Get parameter described by first
				byte.
			>=2	Set parameter described by first
				byte to the value specified in
				the rest of the message.

				Parameters are as follows:

				param	len	description
				0	6	DevEUI-48 and BLE
						MAC address (MSBF)
				1	8	AppEUI-64 (MSBF)
				2	16	AppKey
						(write-only)
				3	TBD	Sensor period

				Parameters 0, 1 and 2 are
				actualized after reboot.

1	Reboot/Upgrade	0	Reboot the mote immediately.
			1	Reboot the mote after the
				specified timeout; optionally
				turn BLE and SUOTA on for
				upgrades.  The argument is as
				follows:
				bit [7]:
					0	just reboot
					1	BLE on
				bits [6:3]:
						Reserved
				bits [2:0]:
					0	TBD
					1	5 minutes
					2	15 minutes
					3	30 minutes
					4	1 hour
					5	2 hours
					6	4 hours
					7	TBD

Uplink reports are as follows:

Number	Name		Length	Description
------	----		------	-----------
0	Param value	>=2	Response to the "Get params"
				command.  The first byte is the
				param number, the rest are the
				value.
1	Sensor data	>=1	Sensor data.
2	Battery level	1	Battery level in 10mV steps from
				2V (0 = 2V, 255 = 4.55V).

Sensor data consists of a byte signifying the sensor type, as
defined in sensor.c, and zero or more bytes of sensor data.  The
defined types and corresponding data formats are:

Number	Name	Data length	Description
------	----	-----------	-----------
0	Unknown	0		No data.
1	GPS	9		GPS coordinates.
2	Temp	1		Temperature.

GPS data format is as follows:

Offset	Length	Description
------	------	-----------
0	1	$GPGGA Position Fix Indicator.  Possible values
		are:
		0	Fix not available or invalid
		1	GPS SPS Mode, fix valid
		2	Differential GPS, SPS Mode, fix valid
		6	Dead Reckoning Mode, fix valid
1	4	Lattitude in 1/1000 of minutes, as little-endian
		int32.  Positive is north, negative is south.  To
		get the value in degrees, divide by 600000.
5	4	Longitude in 1/1000 of minutes, as little-endian
		int32.  Positive is east, negative is west.  To
		get the value in degrees, divide by 600000.

The format of GPS data is subject to change.

Temperature data format is as follows:

Offset	Length	Description
------	------	-----------
0	1	Temperature in degrees Celsius as a signed
		int8_t, giving the range between -128 and +127.
		Temperatures outside this range are not sent.
